The SALT (Social Computing Systems) lab focuses on systems research in social computing. We seek deep understandings of how people interact with sociotechnical computing systems. We develop original designs that either enable new forms of user/social interaction or impact existing user/social interaction. We propose, develop and evaluate novel infrastructure solutions for a variety of social computing applications. Example projects include mobile crowdsourcing systems for public safety, systems for protecting people's privacy in social media, designs for enabling new forms of interactions between librarians and patrons, and mechanisms for making authentication more accessible for people with disabilities. Currently, our research is funded by NSF, Department of Health and Human Services, Institute of Museum and Library Services, Google, Meta, and OpenAI.
